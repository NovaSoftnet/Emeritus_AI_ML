Module 5  Arturo_Noguera_prompt.ipynb Jupyter Notebook is attached to this repository.

The analyzed Data Set in this module comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver

This Jupyter notebook includes the code to analyze the provided Data set related to a coupon campaign targeting different sets of customers and the statistics describing the behavior of these customers, related mainly to the acceptance (or not acceptance) of the sent coupon and different characteristics describing the customers in both scenarios.


This analysis could be used to solve a main question

Will a new Customer  matching a specific profile from the provided Dataset  accept or no accept a specific coupon.

The notebook includes 3 main sections:


1) Understanding , cleaning and prepare provided Data Set for analysis. 

2) Analysis for customers receiving a specific type of coupon (Bar) and the characterization/profiling of different subsets of this type of customers and their associated label (accept/no accept).

3) Analysis for customers receiving a specific type of coupon (Coffeehouse) and the charanterization/profiling of different subsets of this type of customers and their associated label (accept/no accept).

Along with the notebook a brief report with the findings for the 3 sections described above is included in the repository.
